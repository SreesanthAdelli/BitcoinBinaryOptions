# BitcoinBinaryOptions
This project focuses on an automated Bitcoin binary options trading system that uses real-time market data and algorithmic strategies to predict price movements. It incorporates risk management tools to optimize short-term trades in the volatile Bitcoin market. Sadly slightly more advanced models are being used, so it is not profitable.
